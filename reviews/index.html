<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>&#8220;A Life Reclaimed &#8211; A Testament to Daniel’s Genius ❤️&#8221;</strong></h3>



<p>Tags: Submissive, Trauma, Woman, Anxiety</p>



<p>When I first met Daniel, I was unravelling under the weight of lifelong trauma &#8211; years of childhood abuse and multiple abusive marriages had left me exhausted, disconnected, and barely functional. <strong>I had tried traditional therapy for years, and nothing came close to reaching what needed to be healed. I was losing hope.</strong></p>



<p>Then came Daniel.</p>



<p>Daniel is not just a Trauma Hypnotherapist. <strong>He is, without exaggeration, a genius in his field</strong>. His work doesn’t just help people cope &#8211; it creates actual, lasting transformation. Within a relatively short period of working with him, I experienced a shift that no other therapeutic approach had ever come close to delivering. He helped me access the parts of myself that trauma had buried, and reawaken a sense of clarity, self-worth, and direction that I thought was gone forever.</p>



<p><strong>Because of Daniel’s work, I didn’t just get my life back &#8211; I became the most authentic version of myself.</strong> Today, I am leading a company that’s launching in partnership with some of the largest tech firms in the world. I say this not as a boast, but as a reflection of how profound and foundational Daniel’s work has been in my personal and professional rebirth.</p>



<p>He has since helped members of my family and professional network, all of whom have experienced similarly powerful breakthroughs. His ability to guide people through deep trauma, and do it with such efficiency, compassion, and integrity, is beyond compare. What Daniel achieves in weeks or months simply does not exist in the traditional therapy world.</p>



<p>Daniel’s work is not only effective &#8211; it is essential. I believe it belongs on the world stage.</p>



<p><strong>To anyone considering working with Daniel: you won’t just heal &#8211; you’ll evolve. You’ll remember who you were before trauma, and you’ll step into who you’re meant to become.</strong></p>



<p>Thank you, Daniel. Your work is sacred. Your impact is immeasurable.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>&#8220;My first session was both exciting and nerve-wracking ❤️&#8221;</strong></h3>



<p>Tags: Dominant, Man</p>



<p>Before reaching out to Daniel, I had spent a significant amount of time researching different methods to address my anxiety and personal challenges, including cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) and various medications. A personal friend suggested hypnosis, but I was initially sceptical, assuming it was nothing more than pseudoscience &#8211; a way to exploit the desperate and gullible. However, curiosity led me to explore further.</p>



<p>Initially I started by watching YouTube videos on hypnosis and self-hypnosis, testing whether I was even suggestible to the practice. One key takeaway early on was that hypnosis isn’t mind control &#8211; it requires a willingness to engage with suggestions. If a suggestion conflicts with your core values or beliefs, it simply won’t take hold. This realization helped shift my perspective, and I began seeing hypnosis as a tool for re-framing thoughts rather than a passive process.</p>



<p>After nearly a year of independent research, I discovered Daniel through Spotify, where he shares a wealth of free resources in both written and audio formats. <strong>His content stood out because it wasn’t just generic relaxation exercises &#8211; his material tackled deep, meaningful topics in a way that resonated with me. He also offered a free consultation, and on a whim, I decided to reach out.</strong> This was out of character for me, but something about his approach made me feel like he genuinely wanted to help rather than just sell a service.</p>



<p>To my surprise, Daniel responded within the hour and scheduled a call. Though the free consultation was meant to last twenty minutes, he ended up speaking with me for nearly two hours. We discussed the free material he had available, how I had been applying it in my life, and what challenges I was facing. He listened intently, asked insightful questions, and offered practical guidance without any pressure to commit to a paid session. That first conversation alone gave me a sense of clarity I hadn’t found elsewhere.</p>



<p>Naturally, I was still cautious about the financial aspect. I have a limited income and wanted to be sure hypnosis would be effective before making an investment. Daniel was incredibly understanding and worked with me to determine a fair arrangement.</p>



<p><strong>His priority was my progress, not just securing a client, which gave me even more confidence in his integrity.</strong></p>



<p>My first session was both exciting and nerve-wracking. I wasn’t sure what to expect, but I followed his preparation instructions and arrived early. To my surprise, he was already there as well, ready to walk me through the process and discuss any concerns. When the session began, I found the experience deeply immersive &#8211; similar to daydreaming but with a heightened sense of focus. While I remained conscious the entire time, I didn’t recall every detail afterward, yet I left feeling an overwhelming sense of calm and clarity.</p>



<p>One of the aspects I valued most about working with Daniel was his ability to pinpoint the root causes of my struggles rather than just addressing the surface-level symptoms. His reflections and insights helped me make significant mental shifts, and he always encouraged self-exploration beyond the sessions. I also appreciated how he checked in after particularly intense sessions, ensuring I was processing things in a healthy way. <strong>This level of attentiveness and care is rare and speaks volumes about his dedication to his clients.</strong></p>



<p>For those considering hypnosis, I would advise approaching it with an open mind and a willingness to engage in the process. Much like a workout, the effort you put in directly affects the results. Some sessions may bring up unexpected emotions, especially if you are working through trauma, but Daniel creates a safe and supportive environment for that kind of work.</p>



<p>Overall, I cannot recommend Daniel enough. He is compassionate, insightful, and genuinely invested in helping people improve their lives. His non-judgmental approach fosters strength in vulnerability, and his ability to re-frame challenges offers a fresh, empowering perspective. If you’re considering hypnosis as a tool for personal growth, I encourage you to give Daniel a chance &#8211; you may be surprised by what you discover.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>An Incredible Educator❤️</strong></h3>



<p>Tags: Submissive, Woman, Orgasms</p>



<p>My experiences with Daniel have only ever been positive. His compassion and caring love for his clients shines through in his words, actions and impact. They can expect to feel wrapped in the safety of his warm presence and unjudging guidance. He is attentive to all concerns and is thorough in his responses, providing his perspective as well as any outside resources available.</p>



<p>His client reviews are a joy to read, expressing the gratitude and veneration his work inspires. He also dedicates much of his free time to providing informative assistance in an ever evolving network of web-page, wiki and other means of contact through which he openly provides resources and fields questions on the subjects of his expertise.</p>



<p>He is truly a much needed force for good in this world and embodies Tolstoy’s words expressing that intelligent, kind people find more kindness in others.</p>



<p>“The kinder and more intelligent a person is, the more kindness he can find in other people. Kindness enriches our life; with kindness mysterious things become clear, difficult things become easy and dull things become cheerful.” – Leo Tolstoy</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>A Professional Escort and a Lifechanging Surprise ❤️</strong></h3>



<p>Tags: Dominant, Woman, Trauma, Shame, Orgasms</p>



<p>Daniel was an unexpected and life-changing surprise, and I firmly believe that everything happens for a reason.</p>



<p>As a professional, high-level escort for over two years, I was seeking ways to deepen my knowledge and enhance my career. A trusted colleague recommended Daniel, suggesting his podcasts as a valuable resource. After listening to Female Orgasm – The 12 Types, I immediately recognized his profound understanding of women and decided to reach out. He responded promptly and courteously, and through our initial conversation, I learned about his expertise in hypnosis. Intrigued, we decided to address some personal challenges I had been facing.</p>



<p>From overcoming childhood trauma and breaking habits like smoking cigars or indulging in post-dinner sugar cravings, to healing the deep psychological wounds from past relationships, Daniel helped me transform my life in just four sessions.&nbsp;<strong>What I gained was far greater than I had hoped for: the ability to truly love and value myself.</strong></p>



<p>In my line of work, self-love is not only empowering but essential.&nbsp;<strong>Thanks to Daniel, I now fully embrace who I am, what I do, and the positive impact I have on others.</strong>&nbsp;I feel more confident, unapologetic, and authentic in all aspects of my life &#8211; whether meeting new people, standing tall without fear of judgment, or expressing myself through my unique style. I see myself now as a sexy, smart, and creative individual with a meaningful purpose on this Earth.</p>



<p>Beyond personal transformation, Daniel has also guided me in refining my business strategy. His insightful suggestions have significantly boosted my income while helping me find more joy and clarity in my work.</p>



<p>If my experience resonates with you and you’re seeking genuine, lasting change after trying everything else, I wholeheartedly recommend Daniel.</p>



<p><strong>I would also like to highlight his ongoing care and support, which are both exceptional and authentic. His generosity and commitment to his clients are truly rare.</strong></p>



<p>Everyone could benefit from a little “Daniel care” in their life.</p>

<p><em>(Client is in mid-twenties, and was extremely ashamed of physical appearance, her sexuality, was non-orgasmic, and profoundly repressed from trauma and upbringing)</em></p>



<p>Follow-up Notes: <em>After three sessions, Client is now happily bisexual, hyper orgasmic, with indefinite length multiple full body orgasms from simple instruction without requiring physical touch, is vaginally and anally orgasmic as well, and is embracing profound sexual submission and sexual use, and beginning to date enthusiastically, with an abundance mindset. All trauma and past issues have been resolved as well, freeing her to embrace her chosen sexuality)</em></p>



<p>From the first conversation, it’s immediately apparent how passionate Daniel is about his work and the individuals that he works with. From the free resources folder online to his podcast, he has wealth of information that is presented in a way that makes it accessible to every range of person, from experienced to advanced and Dominants to Submissives.</p>



<p>I was an avid listener of the Wordsmith via his SoundGasm files and wish I’d reached out sooner. I was admittedly still hesitant about my ability to be hypnotized or benefit from hypnosis, but Daniel took his time and made the entire experience incredibly enjoyable and beyond worth it.&nbsp;<strong>My life has been permanently changed in positive, meaningful ways and I couldn’t be more grateful.</strong>&nbsp;I’ve struggled with my outward confidence and body image for most of my life, and working with Daniel has allowed me to take pride in myself where I am now, and the strength to get to where I want to be.&nbsp;<strong>I’m incredibly grateful for his guidance and wisdom</strong>.</p>



<p>Anyone who’s even remotely interested in improving their life in any capacity should absolutely reach out.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Hypnotic work sometimes seems like magic to me … What seemed hard is suddenly perfectly easy. I recommend him unequivocally. ❤️</strong></h3>



<p>Tags: Submissive, Woman, Trauma</p>



<p><em>(Client is an Older Woman, Married, in an intense D/s relationship and dealing with unmet needs.</em></p>



<p>As a mature woman, in a long marriage to a man who had become extremely preoccupied with his business life, I worked with Daniel to find a new way of engagement with my husband. Whilst we addressed a number of matters both in trance and conversational hypnosis, I want to specifically address in this review the work we did with my misunderstanding of what being a submissive actually entails. He helped me to understand that a Submissive is elegant, valuable and a desirable state of being and living. Whilst I had long ago come to terms with expectations as to what was required of me on a day to day basis, I was struggling to accept, in an embodied way, that I also had a responsibility to contribute to bringing to life the expression of my sexual needs and desires as a submissive woman.</p>



<p>Somewhere and somehow, long ago, a belief had embedded in my brain that the Dominant provides leadership and that the submissive receives what is offered to her. If she is offered nothing, she goes without. I had spoken with other Dominants over time who had encouraged flexibility in this mindset. I had tried to adjust my way of thinking to accommodate my new life situation with little success. How could I feel the submission if I was in some way orchestrating the play? And, if I didn’t orchestrate at least some play, how could I get the play I really and truly needed? I truly was ‘stuck’.</p>



<p>When a message is embedded for decades, it takes time to install a completely different message. Daniel and I worked together on practicing this, finding words and situations where I was more the initiator. We then let things rest a bit and returned to it recently.</p>



<p>Daniel has come to know me as someone akin to a dog with a bone and this led to work with symbols of strength and utilisation of the Wisdom of One’s Higher Self. Not only did I feel less alone, since I had an inner companion, but I also had clarity around what I wanted, and therefore more commitment to resolve this matter. Whilst at the time I didn’t know why we were doing this, he successfully integrated my separated and wounded ego states together.&nbsp;<strong>I was feeling more settled. I was more open; more ‘together’.</strong></p>



<p>Hypnotic work sometimes seems like magic to me because it encompasses disparate notions and crystallizes them where the mind has opened up to something new. What seemed hard is suddenly perfectly easy. In my case, he had, over this time period, mentioned the words ‘do your job’, not directed at me, and yet somehow they stuck, and surfaced in fantasies. Ideas were melding together.</p>



<p>After our last session, I allowed my mind to rest and just focussed on feeling my way through the days. Several days after his work, relaxed and content in myself, my mind was bringing up tangible solutions. Why not I write a scene to give to my husband to act out? Why not I explain how I wanted this scene to go, right down to how I didn’t want ‘traditional’ after care but rather wanted to be told that this was all real? (a concept I picked up on listening to your podcast) I really was a slave at heart. I really did belong to him.</p>



<p><strong>Here was my authentic Self, the wisest part of me, in conjunction with my Heart, seeing it all crystal clear.</strong></p>



<p>Not only did this sort of initiation of play suddenly seem as easy as eating cake, it felt like I was embodying the submission; deepening it and cementing it as a vital, joyful, and essential part of my entity.</p>



<p>I know I was a challenging client but Daniel was as determined to find a solution for me as I was to not give up on myself, or the marriage.. Giving up wasn’t an option. We explored that too. No option as was off the table, but he always instructed me to act in my “Long Term Highest Good” (another phrase which if you have listened to his podcast you will be familiar with).</p>



<p><strong>Daniel is the genuine article and I can say that having come to know him over a period of time, a rare find.</strong>&nbsp;His preparation work is solid and meticulous (which I think is the key to successful hypnosis), making the time together valuable and successful. His demeanour is professional and non-judgmental and most importantly, he cares.&nbsp;<strong>I recommend him unequivocally.</strong></p>

<p>why does everything in the house feel new??</p>



<p>i’m making my boyfriend Gatorade super early in the morning, while he’s clocked-in doing work on his laptop. and i’m just looking around at the kitchen, in the dawn morning light.</p>



<p>and it feels like everything is brand new?</p>



<p><strong>it feels like i’m truly in reality?</strong>&nbsp;which might sound strange at first—but it’s that there’s no anxiety preventing me from being&nbsp;<em>actually</em>&nbsp;present anymore.</p>



<p>it feels SO familiar. but yet i don’t remember feeling this way since i was a child in Ireland. at least 16 years ago.</p>



<p>i can’t believe i haven’t been present for so long, Daniel.<br>it’s cathartic to feel free finally. but also terribly sad to realize how much time was lost—and that there are so many others are still stuck in the trauma</p>

<p>Hi Daniel, I found you in the last few months and have now listened to most of your episodes.</p>



<p>Wanted to let you know how thankful for your help in overcoming shame and guilt I have been.</p>



<p>I would never be able to say out loud some of the things that I truly desire, tried your 12 fantasy technique, to write down the fantasy and the fears or concerns about it, and I have shocked myself with it, my husband is thrilled, and is always tortured by my inability to say anything out loud due to shame.</p>



<p>You have helped me overcome a lot of my barriers, I am own biggest “cock-block” mostly caused by shame and with other information you have given me in other episodes you have changed my life. Thank-you for sharing your knowledge with the world.</p>



<p>I also have a learning disability and am able to absorb your information easier than any other podcast, with the extra analogies and examples you give.</p>

<p>Tags: Shame, Woman</p>



<p><em>(Client is a 52 year old woman on two separate anti-depressants who presented with difficulty experiencing orgasms, guilt around her submission)</em></p>



<p>There’s an old saying that goes: “when the Student is ready, the Teacher appears”. That is exactly what happened when I stumbled across Daniel’s podcast and hypnosis files.</p>



<p>For context, I’m a 52-year-old woman who was in the midst of a combined midlife crisis and burnout. I was on two different antidepressants, struggling to understand why I was always sabotaging myself in all areas of my life. For years, I had been wrestling with the harsh reality that my life was not turning out the way I had hoped. Every morning I woke up with a sense of dread, weighed down by the monotony and the feeling that I was trapped in a cycle of self-sabotage. I longed for change but felt powerless to initiate it. This feeling of being stuck was exacerbated by my burnout, which left me mentally and physically exhausted. I couldn’t see a way out, and my antidepressants seemed to only take the edge off my despair rather than truly alleviating it.</p>



<p>Despite countless efforts and DECADES of therapy, it felt like the best I could do was survive, and I was tired of it.</p>



<p>I started listening to guided meditation and hypnosis files at night to help battle insomnia and anxiety. Soon, I realized there is a severe lack of good male hypnotists, specifically men who possess a pleasant voice and know how to use it to take the listener into a trance that is both pleasurable and therapeutic, in a positive behavioural change sense. One sleepless night, in a desperate attempt to find some solace, I started exploring podcasts and audio files that might offer some relief. That’s when I discovered Daniel’s podcast. My fascination with hypnosis had been a private curiosity for a long time, and here was a man who spoke about these subjects with such clarity and respect that I felt immediately drawn to his content.</p>



<p>His voice, deep and soothing, was unlike any other I had encountered. It was evident that he knew exactly how to guide a listener into a state of relaxation and introspection. He has a way of making you feel absolutely safe and absolutely seen. He was patient and kind, always encouraging me not to censor myself.</p>



<p>From the beginning of our very first conversation, it was obvious how passionate he is about helping people heal and reach their fullest potential. When I asked to book a session with him, I never would have believed that it could have such an immediate and potent effect. I would stake my life on this – our sessions were more beneficial than YEARS of any clinical therapy I’ve had to date. Daniel took time to explain the mechanisms behind hypnosis and how it could help me address my deepest issues. He asked me to write down everything I wanted to work on, which in itself was a therapeutic exercise. For the first time, I was articulating my struggles and goals in a structured way. Daniel also provided me with pre-session preparation audios so that I could come to the session ready to dive in. These audios helped me to focus and set the stage for the work we were about to do. He was always positive, confident, and encouraging – and always concerned with giving me the most value he could.</p>



<p><strong>He had no personal agenda other than helping me.</strong></p>



<p>Even so, I was extremely nervous and agitated at the beginning of the first session. Would it actually work for me? Could I handle letting go and facing all the mess inside? Daniel knew just what to do – he was the voice in the dark that gave me the courage to let go of so much childhood pain, shame, and anger. His calming presence and expert guidance made it possible for me to trust the process. In that darkness, I learned to love myself for the first time. His words and guidance gave meaning to all the core belief visualizations. <strong>Most importantly, Daniel never pushed anything or crossed a single boundary</strong>. He put me completely at ease with a direct, non-judgmental style of communication that made it easy to speak candidly about incredibly intimate and emotional personal details. I had been carrying these burdens for so long that sharing them felt like a release. His approach was professional yet compassionate, making me feel understood and valued.</p>



<p><strong>Seriously, people pay thousands of dollars for Ayahuasca healing retreats in Peru to have the kind of life-altering experience that Daniel gave me with 90 minutes and a headset!</strong> I’ve come alive again; that’s the only way I can explain it. Working with Daniel and my own Unconscious Mind has woken up the version of me that I always hoped to be. I’ve been able to reconnect and repair friendships, provide a fully present ear to others, and offer insights that helped their own troubles. I can regulate myself emotionally without any effort. Best of all is the overwhelming sense of peace, joy, and gratitude for who I am and what I have.</p>



<p>I am not kidding about this! <strong>The first time I came close enough to my old ruminations to feel pain, all my negative emotions suddenly drained away and were replaced by a sense of happiness and pleasure that steadily built into the most powerful, mind-melting bliss I’ve ever felt. An orgasm so strong that is has to be felt to be believed.</strong> Anyone who has experienced the sexual dysfunction side effects of antidepressant medications knows the struggle with loss of libido, sensation, and difficulty reaching orgasm. Frankly, I forgot my body could feel pleasure at all, let alone that intensely. What used to be something I had to work for with the aid of toys is now something I can just close my eyes and access at any time, for as long as I want.</p>



<p>There are so many other small positive changes, it’s hard to list them all! I’m exercising, sketching, and laughing again. I dance in the kitchen and hug my friends and family. My stress level has dropped considerably. I was able to drop one SSRI and am titrating down on the other. After losing heart and isolating myself from everyone, I am once again enjoying the company of others. Now, I feel capable of authentically connecting in healthy, meaningful ways with the kinds of people who are right for me.</p>



<p>Daniel, I can’t thank you enough for the privilege of working with you. You made it possible for me to not only have a second chance at life but to actually WANT that chance. You have helped me uncover parts of myself that I thought were lost forever. The light on my inner horizon has brightened, and I feel a renewed sense of purpose and direction. Your dedication and expertise have been a beacon in my darkest times, guiding me towards a life filled with hope, happiness, and fulfillment. I look forward to continuing this journey of self-discovery and healing, and to share it with as many people as I can. Thank you for helping me find the strength within myself to embrace life again.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>My Submissive Self used to be blocked by Guilt and Shame ❤️</strong></h3>



<p><em>(Sexually Submissive – Wanted to explore Erotic Hypnosis and find a Worthy Partner to share herself with)</em></p>



<p>If it seems like I’m gushing, that’s because I am. Daniel rewrote my very Core in powerful and empowering ways, and always in service of my highest good. And, wow, does that make a difference! After working with Daniel, I’m less timid, less anxious, and more open and confident. I feel safer allowing myself to embrace who I am and be vulnerable, always with someone worthy. And my orgasms are So. Much. Better. Seriously, Daniel can accomplish more remotely than any man I’ve met in person can from the same room. No joke.</p>



<p><strong>If you’ve found Daniel and you’re thinking about getting in touch, you absolutely should.</strong>&nbsp;He’s exceptionally skilled, trust-worthy, and he will meet you where you’re at without judgment. Working in partnership together (because it is absolutely a collaboration between the two of you), you’ll be surprised at just how quickly you’ll see results. Positive, permanent, empowering results. Results that extend over many areas of your life. That’s been my experience. I stumbled across Daniel online and made the best decision I’ve made in a long time. I reached out and got in touch.</p>



<p>He’s an extremely talented and extensively knowledgeable hypnotist, and I felt safe with him from our first conversation. Which is saying something as I’ve long struggled with anxiety and trust issues,&nbsp;<strong>and actually had an honest to god panic attack on the phone with him during our first call</strong>. I was mortified, and under other circumstances would have likely ended the call abruptly and never called back, except for how very warm and understanding he was. He put me at ease and I had my first trance guided by his Voice (which is, by the way, not entirely unlike warm honey). The first thing he did was to address my anxiety, processing my nervousness for me, and creating space to address my needs and desires in an entirely new, healthier way.</p>



<p><strong>As a naturally submissive woman, I’ve been drawn to both hypnosis and BDSM for a long time; but I was blocked from exploring that side of myself by the corrosive effects of guilt and shame</strong>. It took finding Daniel for me to begin to acknowledge, accept, and even embrace myself, and it has been a truly transformative experience. To finally start to become comfortable in my own skin and mind. To be treated without judgment or scorn. To live with less fear and honest joy. These are all part and parcel of the positive changes I’ve undergone. I am not now the person I was a year ago, but I might just be the person I was always meant to be.</p>



<p>As a direct result of the work we’ve done, I am learning just how very satisfying it can be to be of service. How exciting it is to be praised. How thrilling it is to be called a good girl. Every. Single. Time.&nbsp;<strong>I can’t wait to find more ways to be of service to someone worthy of my submission</strong>, to make them happy, to make them smile. Because I love it. It makes me happy and gives me a thrill. I am hopelessly devoted. And it’s a joy I wouldn’t have been able to allow myself before working with Daniel. He’s been very patient with me throughout this process. So very patient. And this journey has been . . . a revelation. Daniel is extraordinary. So much so that I think I’m beginning to understand worship. It’s a totally natural progression. When I’ve run out of ways to say thank you. When words aren’t enough. As they so often aren’t.</p>



<p>I’ve always been afraid of my feelings. That they were both too much and not enough. And Daniel makes it so easy.</p>



<p>As a side note, although this wasn’t the express purpose of the hypnosis and conditioning Daniel performs, there were noticeable effects in other areas of my life, as well. Because part of the sessions that Daniel rewrote for me involved treating myself with the same love and kindness I show others and accepting that I was the only person responsible for my happiness, another natural progression of this process has been to look for and embrace opportunities to live these beliefs. For example, for the first time in my life I’m enjoying exercise. I’m motivated; taking better care of myself, and working on improving my health and wellness. For another example, I haven’t smoked in years. Most of the time it’s easy. Every once in a while the urge pops up again. Recently, I found myself thinking about bumming a cigarette after a stressful couple of days. A slippery slope I’ve slid down in the past. This time, when I was feeling tempted, I was reminded of Daniel, and I knew, immediately, the right thing to do. And it was easy.</p>



<p>That’s the other thing. Change can be scary for everyone sometimes. But I was surprised by just how much this process hasn’t really felt like change at all. It felt like I was simply becoming more myself. And the process is inherently pleasurable, too.</p>



<p><strong>In short, working with Daniel has been effective and fun. He’s a warm and caring individual with a strong moral center and a deep desire to make the world a better place by increasing the amount of love, joy, and connection. You can’t be in better hands, and I cannot recommend him highly enough.</strong></p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>You are Amazing at what you do! ❤️</strong></h3>



<p><em>(Sexually Submissive – Struggled with acceptance of Submissive Desires and profound guilt)</em></p>



<p>First of all, thank you Daniel. I know I’ve said it before but I will keep on saying it, I will never be able to say it enough. For as long as I can remember, I have struggled with my self-image. Had horrible thoughts about myself, quite honestly, I hated myself. Thinking back to how I used to feel is bringing me to tears as I write this. How could I look at myself that way? Why was I so unfair to myself? I don’t know the answers to those questions but that’s okay, they aren’t important. What IS important, is that they have gone. Somehow Daniel, you’ve changed such an intrinsic part of me, for the better. I didn’t believe it after the session, that the changes you put into motion would actually happen, that they would stick. I do now though. I’ve accepted them as truth, my new reality. My acceptance took a while but here is my journey.</p>



<p><strong>You have changed my life</strong>. I will forever be grateful to you for that. I’m someone that is experienced with hypnosis and familiar with hypnotherapy. I went into this session knowing that real changes can be made, but also doubting how well things would work for me. When I’ve tried to make positive changes with hypnosis in the past, small positive changes had occurred, briefly, until they became overwhelmed by the negativeness that I was trying to combat. This time was different. You know what you are doing. You don’t just know the techniques, you understand them, you are able to craft such a masterpiece from all of your knowledge and experience. The session that we had together was truly amazing.</p>



<p>The day of the session I was hopeful, but reluctant to believe anything had truly changed. I was scared of believing it had worked, in case it hadn’t. I didn’t want to get my hopes up. I did as you said and took the time to speak to my unconscious multiple times throughout the day. The first time I was filled with a warm glow of positive energy, the second time that feeling grew, and the third time… the third time she answered me. I love her and she loves me.&nbsp;<strong>The craziest thing of all is that I love myself. I still can’t believe that I’m saying that truthfully. I love myself.</strong></p>



<p>The changes you helped me create have been tested. Since our session I’ve been changing my antidepressants and my general mood has fallen through the floor. Yet, despite my worsening symptoms of depression, none of the negative thoughts turned towards myself. Previously when my depression spiked I got intense negative thoughts about myself, but this time that hasn’t happened. Even when I’m doubting everything in my life, I can still genuinely say that I love myself and it blows my mind.</p>



<p>So, once again, thank you Daniel. That acceptance of myself has had a really lovely unexpected effect. I’m finding myself naturally choosing to do things that are good for me. The healthier lifestyle I’ve been trying to lead – changing my diet and upping my exercise, the better decisions have started to come naturally. I keep on noticing little changes that are happening, new and exciting moments that<br>fill me with hope for the future and leave me smiling for the rest of the day. For the first time in what feels like forever, I can look at myself and see the good where before I only saw the bad.</p>



<p>You are amazing at what you do, you should be proud of the difference that you make to the lives of so many people.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>There’s just no more Pain ❤️</strong></h3>



<p><em>(Submissive with Chronic Pain from Intense Periods, that was referred by a Submissive Friend of hers that I worked with)</em></p>



<p>A little while after we started our sessions, I mentioned to you how much I was struggling with my period. I’ve always had heavy periods, the sort that leave me unable to do much of anything for days. A couple of months ago I found a solution to the heavy bleeding, a godsend that I’m annoyed my Doctors didn’t suggest sooner. These pills have meant I have the energy to do things, but the cramping and the pain, they made that worse. I mentioned this to you, in passing. We had just started doing sessions together and I had started my period and was complaining about the pain. Then you go and say something interesting like you always do, about being able to use orgasms to counteract period cramps, something to do with the muscles being contracted and the pleasure felt from orgasm.</p>



<p>Like most things you tell me, I was in disbelief at what you said. I believed it was possible, I have more than enough reason to trust what you say at this point, but I didn’t truly believe it until I saw, or rather, felt it. You gave the suggestion for me to internally orgasm at the site of my period pains when they happened, so that the cramps would be counteracted and I wouldn’t be in pain. Or something like that anyway. You gave this gift to me during our session on the last day of my period, so I remained doubtful that it would work. The idea of not being affected by my period hardly at all was too good to be true. Like most things with you, I didn’t want to get my hopes up. Then came the waiting… a whole month. My period started, I took my pills, the first day came and went, and nothing.</p>



<p>Not that surprising as the first day is normally a gentle one for me. The days passed, my period ended and I hadn’t been in pain once! I still can’t believe it. I felt the physical movement of the cramping on occasion&nbsp;<strong>but there was no pain, not even really any discomfort, just knowledge that they were happening. A whole 5 day period with no pain. I’ve had cramps in the past, on a regular basis, that left me curled up in bed with a stuffie I can put in the microwave or a hot water bottle, for hours on end. You leave me in awe again and again and again.</strong>&nbsp;I had a period with no pain. It feels a bit like a dream, but it happened, it really happened. Thank you. Between you helping with the pain and these pills that reduce my blood flow to a normal amount, i’m finally able to live properly again. Up until the beginning of the year I spent a quarter of my life curled up in bed barely able to do anything, thinking this was going to be my reality until my periods stop. You’ve changed that, made me able to do things again during my period without worry of pain and cramping. Amazing. You are amazing</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>How Incredibly Satisfying it is to Have Made a Connection With You ❤️</strong></h3>



<p>Daniel, my apologies, I’ve been traveling out here in the great Southwest over the past few days.</p>



<p>Yes, I am extremely happy with the results so far, based on the changes I’ve been observing in my thoughts and responses, or when I notice that something doesn’t bother me now that would have earlier.</p>



<p>Because I have been so wrapped up in my work, and haven’t had a chance to test everything out, obviously, I realize there will be much more to come “around the corner”.</p>



<p><strong>I hope I can convey my sentiments adequately so that you will understand just how incredibly satisfying it is to have made a connection with you</strong>&nbsp;– a person so deeply knowledgeable and well-intentioned who I feel completely comfortable with and trust to consult for advice to guide this important part of my life. I feel that your work is just as important to the human body as a physician’s – as your work is centred not just on having a healthy body but for it to be able to used to its fullest potential to provide pleasure, allowing one to revel in enjoying the passage of time.</p>



<p>And your guidance for pursuing pleasure with the absence of guilt or shame&nbsp;<strong>as most highly needed, oh, I don’t know, for world, peace, and happiness</strong>, and all that stuff, as important as any advice that could be provided by a priest or rabbi in just learning to be completely happy.</p>



<p>Playing in the background of my mind is the Beatles’, “all you need is love”. I think that pretty well sums everything up.</p>



<p>I think it’s fantastic you have made so many resources available to support your sessions.</p>



<p>Now with a little more time this week between sessions than we normally have, I’m looking forward to reading through more of it, as well as the book and other material.</p>



<p>I am pleased I have found this amazing opportunity to allow you to “hold my hand along the way” and to have the benefit of your encouragement while I explore this new chapter.&nbsp;<strong>I applaud the day that you made the decision to turn toward devoting your life to provide education to others to enlighten them on the ways they can get so much more out of being alive.</strong></p>



<p>To have discovered you out there in the great wilderness is an awesome and joyous thing, indeed.</p>

<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity">



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>You Have to Do This, You Deserve It ❤️</strong></h3>



<p><strong>I could not recommend him more highly. You deserve this!</strong></p>



<p><strong>Getting in touch with Daniel after listening to a number of his podcasts is one of the best decisions I have ever made</strong>. A woman in her 60s, I spoke to Daniel about two issues which had been disturbing me for well over a decade. I had done my own personal research and worked for a time with two psychologists about my concerns with only limited success. I knew well enough that there was emotional neglect in my childhood that had led to codependent behaviours, and that these had been affecting my Ds relationships, but it didn’t ease feelings of inadequate self-worth and how to effectively create boundaries. Aware of Internal Family Systems, there was a part of me not fully integrated.&nbsp;<strong>Daniel was patient with me, caring and he was completely without judgment.</strong>&nbsp;Under hypnosis I was instantly comfortable and after even one session, the results were outstanding. I walked much lighter immediately. In only two sessions we accomplished what would have taken months of work in any other way. There was a recognizable and permanent shift in my sense of wellbeing which then allowed us to look at my marriage.*</p>



<p>Daniel is not only an extremely skilled therapist but also a highly knowledgeable person in all areas related to kink.&nbsp;<strong>As a sexually submissive woman, I asked for Daniel’s help to transform what had become an unsatisfying marriage back into one where my submissive sexual orientation could be expressed</strong>. Daniel has an innate understanding of the foundational work that may need to take place before a relationship problem can be resolved. He was excellent at also working with my Husband to create a dynamic that we were both excited about going forward. He’s an extremely enthusiastic and committed hypnotist who held us with proficient care when we were at our most vulnerable, creating lasting and wonderful changes in our lives.</p>



<p>UPDATE: P.S. What an oversight! I can’t leave without saying what a BLAST it was to know that I was capable of coming on demand. I/We had that after that final, very excellent trance. It was mind blowing, one of life’s highs. There’s a greedy part to me, I know this. I know what great sex is, and I want it.</p>



<p>So, an enormous thank you.</p>



<p>-R</p>



<p>SIX MONTH FOLLOW UP</p>



<p>There’s no need to respond, but I very much want you to know how happy I am, how calm and peaceful inside I feel. I have learned so much lately, it all just fell into place. I was so meant for this.</p>



<p>THANK YOU 🙏</p>



<p>It’s fascinating how things came together. I really did listen to the things you said to me about my behaviour. It definitely gave me to pause and think. And then at the same time he was getting very stern with me, creating rules, talking about consequences, testing, having me compile what he said into a list for the Agreement. I realised he was actually right. My emotional outrages were causing trouble. There were better ways to handle issues.</p>



<p>And yesterday we walked to lunch together and he said to me it reminded him of us in our trip to XXXX and I had that “dreamy, empty mind, floating thing” about me. And that’s true! I sleep much deeper, I feel happy and so calm and peaceful, all the more so when he lays down the law. I guess you might say, I feel safe and secure.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity">



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Helping Me To Explore My Submissiveness ❤️</strong></h3>



<p>Sometimes you meet people at the right time who can help you in your own development, in the most unlikely situations. If I hadn’t been looking for an interesting podcast on my cell phone out of boredom last September, I would never have come into contact with Daniel.</p>



<p>I had been interested in hypnosis and BDSM for a long time. Both had become increasingly fascinating to me over time. Daniel’s podcast was just right for me. At the same time, I really liked his voice. There are only a few men on the internet who speak high quality BDSM hypnosis. And unfortunately I prefer male voices to female voices (sorry sisters).</p>



<p>So one day, I did something I had never done before: I got in touch!<br>Daniel asked me if I would be interested in a free, no-obligation phone call. After a few technical difficulties and misunderstandings (English is not my native language), it happened.</p>



<p>Due to experiences in my family of origin, I had a “pain box” (as I called it) in which I had packed all the negative feelings I couldn’t deal with in my childhood. In all my adult years, I never had the courage to open this box. With Daniel’s help, I managed to open and empty it under hypnosis in only one session. And as Daniel promised me, to this day it has not closed again or filled up with new pain. On the contrary: bright light now shines from this box. This means everything to me.</p>



<p>In another important session, I was able to move the “huge walls” that I felt surrounded by into the distance, so that they can now only be seen as a distant mountain range. Since no one’s soul (inner life) should be without protection, Daniel helped me to erect a “fence” around me and my “front garden”. At the beginning, this fence had no door. I just couldn’t manage to “set one up”. With his help, I managed to leave this garden through a door, which was another hugely important step for me. It meant that I could finally let in the right person, rather than pushing everyone away.</p>



<p>Moving the “huge walls” and creating a door in my garden fence, as well as opening the door and walking through it, had a liberating effect on me!</p>



<p>I had previous therapy experience and can confirm that Daniel knows what he is doing professionally and also has high therapeutic ethics.</p>



<p>Daniel never pushed me in any particular direction. It didn’t always go as smoothly as it might sound now, but he was always respectfully patient, confident and my trust in him grew noticeably on this journey. Even the time difference – we live on different continents – or my lack of English was never a problem.</p>



<p>In the meantime, I was able to get involved in a BDSM session with a real person. I only told Daniel about it later. He is currently helping me to better understand my “submissiveness”, to communicate my boundaries and desires, and only with dominant men who are worthy of my trust!</p>



<p>I don’t know how I will develop further, but for a long time I had the feeling that I was stuck in my life. And I’m grateful to him that this has now changed. The light on my inner horizon has become brighter at a time when it seems to be getting darker in the real world.</p>
